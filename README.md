# Allium

Allium is a beautiful text editor for iOS made in SwiftUI. It is compatible with iOS 15 and above. It is named after the Allium flower ðŸŒ¸.

This app is planned to be on the App Store, and I may distribute TestFlight links soon!

Planned features:
- Markdown support
- Ability to export all notes in a ZIP file or an AAR file.
- Ability to export singular notes as TXT, MD, and RTF.

Features that may also happen, but aren't guaranteed:
- Siri Shortcuts actions.
- Custom Themes
- Syntax highlighting for HTML documents
- Ability to preview HTML pages
